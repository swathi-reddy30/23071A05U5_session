Got it! Here's a detailed yet clear explanation about *Servlets*:

---

A *Servlet* is a Java program that runs on a web server and handles requests from web clients, usually browsers. It is a core technology in Java used to create *dynamic web applications. Servlets are part of the **Java EE (Jakarta EE)* platform and work on the *server-side* to process client requests, perform backend logic, interact with databases, and generate responses—usually in the form of HTML pages.

When a user interacts with a website (like submitting a form), the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The *Servlet* receives this request through methods like doGet() or doPost(), processes it (e.g., reading form data, querying a database), and sends back a response using the HttpServletResponse object.

Servlets are typically used in combination with *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* on the frontend. They can be deployed on a *Java servlet container* like *Apache Tomcat*, which manages the servlet lifecycle—from creation and initialization to handling requests and eventually destroying the servlet.

Some key features of Servlets:

* *Platform-independent*: Written in Java, so they can run on any server with a Java runtime.
* *Efficient*: Unlike CGI, which creates a new process per request, servlets use threads to handle multiple requests within a single process.
* *Reusable and Scalable*: Multiple clients can use the same servlet simultaneously, and code can be reused across different parts of an application.
* *Extensible*: Servlets can be combined with technologies like JSP (JavaServer Pages) for better presentation logic.

In modern Java web development, servlets are often the foundation upon which more advanced frameworks (like Spring MVC) are built.
